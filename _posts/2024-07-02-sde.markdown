Spectral Density Estimation (SDE) is the problem of efficiently learning the distribution of eigenvalues of a graph and has broad applications in computational science and network science. In this paper, we present new fast and simple randomized and deterministic algorithms for spectral density estimation via a new notion of graph sparsification, which we call nuclear sparsification.
