Clustering is a fundamental problem in machine learning. There are a
variety of clustering algorithms in the literature; however, there is
scant guidance on choosing a good clustering algorithm for a dataset
at hand. In this paper we approach the problem of clustering
algorithm selection using a semi-supervised framework. We present
algorithms that use a small subset of the data to provably estimate the
performance of three classic clustering algorithms: k-means++, k-centers, and
single linkage hierarchical clustering on the full dataset. We support
our theoretical results with experiments on several real-world clustering
instances. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14332">arxiv</a>)
